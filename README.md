A fun mini project to implement Web Scraping Script in Python and fetch required details from a website. 

Extract some data from a comics site and write it in a text file using Selenium and BeautifulSoup modules. Then wrote the Latest Chapter number and the URL details in a text file. 

Also made a standalone executable file using pyinstaller. The .exe file will create a text file containing data in its current path. It will work with a Chrome browser version 92 in Windows 10. But Windows or the antivirus software will flag it as a malicious script and block it.
